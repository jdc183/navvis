=================================================

The URDF
--------

There's just a box representing the complex chassis, and cylinders representing the wheels.  The lasers are more complex meshes, provided by Hokuyo and Velodine. The wheels are on continuous revolute joints, and everything else is fixed.

The Launch
----------
This xacros the xacro into a urdf, and sets up the jsp and rsp for rviz.  Then it launches rviz.

The Read Me
----------
That's this.
